Add a system where when you pause a menu of the boat comes up where you can assign people to different parts of the boat which increases/decreases stats.
The maximum amount increases with every new level and the helicopter gives people and sinkbombs instead of stats.
the stats increased are sinkbomb speed, health/regen(?), and boat speed
